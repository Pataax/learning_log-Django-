We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allow users 
to log the topics they're intertested in and to make journal 
entrie as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home
page should describe the site and invite user to either 
register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able
to create new topics, add new entries, and read and exit
existing entries.
